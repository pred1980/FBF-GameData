*** HEROES ***

Ice Avatar:

- The Ice Avatar is a bit buggy, if u Repick him and select him (not picking), he has 15 skill points left, but 3 out of 4 skills maxed, means he got 10 skillpoints too much. 
  if u pick him again, you start normal with 1 skillpoint, still its a bug

Nerubian Widow:

- if you play All Pick Mode, and you click on Nerubian Widow, you can skill her Ulti, it isnt skilled like the rest of the heroes have everything skilled.

*** TOWERS ***

Tower Build Area:

- first, i wanted to Post this in General Gameplay, but since i couldnt i Post it here, since it has to do something with Towers.
  In the Map are many Places where you are "allowed" to build Towers, but you cant, i made an example as
  its not a real bug, but till final version this should be fixed over the whole map

Decayed Earth Tower:

- The Decayed Earth Tower is either too strong or way too cheap, you can kill nearly everything 1hit in the first waves for 1 price of 225 wood
