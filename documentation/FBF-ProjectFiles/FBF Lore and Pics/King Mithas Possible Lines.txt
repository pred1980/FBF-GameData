First Spawn:
~Long live the King!
~Remember us! Remember The Forsaken!
~I AM the King and this is MY realm! You shan't escape!!
~In peace, the living bury the dead. In war, I bury you!
~From my land, no one escapes!
~I am King Mithas! With the touch of death.
~One HEART to rule them ALL!
~The peace of undeath is only peace this world can get!
~Tremble, mortals, and despair! Doom has come to this world!
~Come, you heroes! In all your power and glory! In the final hour, all must serve the one-true-king.

2nd/3rd Spawns:
~Release me! I COMMAND you!
~Don't do this at home, kids!
~My son! -He is inside!
~There is no good and evil! There is only power, and those too weak to seek it.
~L'Etat c'est moi!
~Long Live Me!
~To die, or not to die.
~You cannot kill me! I have the one true ring of power!! -Oh, wait...
~Avada Kedavra!
~You shan't kill my master! Or my SON!!
------------------------------------------------------------------
~NEVER! I... I will never... serve... you
~I will show you the justice of the grave. And the true meaning of fear!
