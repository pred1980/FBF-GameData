			[tdalt]
				More than a 100 years ago, there existed a kingdom; all the power 
				concentrated in the one King. Although a totalitarian, despotic regime, the 
				kingdom thrived thanks to its well organized economy and hard-working 
				citizens. Under its control, were rich and unique resources and a particularly 
				fertile land. In a short time after its foundation, the kingdom became almost 
				independent; It generated most of what it needed on itself and the excessess 
				were sold or traded.

				For as perfect as the kingdom seemed to the outside world, life on the inside 
				was unbearable for everyone; the King included. His Majesty had everything he 
				wanted, yet he always wanted more. His thirst was insatiable. His castle was 
				two times as big as the second biggest one; his wives were many; his daughter 
				were his brides-to-be; his people acted as mindless peons, doing everything he 
				ordered; his armies were vast, outmatched and, most importantly, loyal to the 
				end. In spite of all this, he wanted more.

				Before he even realized, he was old. Not long after, he found an answer in 
				magic. “By chance”, a travelling Wizard met the King on the street and offered 
				him the solution to his problem. Of course, looks are deceiving and the King 
				was too blinded to see through the fraud, not even when his life force and was 
				drained by his latest newborn. A side effect of the spell, the King was granted 
				eternal youth but conditions were that, if he had a male child, his essence 
				would be consumed and absorbed into his son's.

				The people were astonished at the King's sudden demise; not knowing if to 
				laugh or cry. Swiftly, the Wizard took the child and the throne. The greatest 
				kingdom ever known now at his vile hands. For a reason unascertained, the 
				Wizard killed all of the King's wives, daughters and sons with one powerful 
				spell, with the exception of the youngest of them all. The tamed people 
				accepted their fate disgustingly easily, even for the Wizard. And the loyal army 
				was made to believe the Wizard was the King with a simple illusionary spell.
				 
				The Kingdom fell quickly into disgrace as the Wizard didn't care about politics 
				and economy, only the consumption of souls. He had taken his first victim in 
				the King and he had his future vessel ready, in the King's youngest son, Necro 
				Necromansen [prototype name, of course].

				The unlucky child had a golden heart, but his mind and soul were shaped at 
				the Wizard's will. His sense of morals and ethics were distorted and, for his 
				whole life he lived in a crafted world, twisted and corrupt. His appearance soon 
				changed accordingly and he became a dull, pale, emotionless, almost lifeless child.
				  
				Years went on. With each one, hundreds of souls were absorbed by Necro's. He 
				was like a sponge: all he touched, he consumed. The inanimate corpses filled 
				the streets and buildings of the Kingdom until nothing remained. Finally, a 100 
				years ago, the Wizard's and Necro's souls were fused into one.
				 
				Only too late, the Wizard realized the flaw of his plan, Necro's golden Heart. 
				Unpierced by the conjurer's malice, it alone interrupted the spell and as the 
				Wizard pushed harder into Necro's soul, the young agonizing prince's body 
				imploded. His heart surrounded by all the souls consumed, are all that 
				remained. The Wizard and the Prince forever trapped in the Golden Heart. The 
				Wizard's will still prevailed, easily overpowering Necro's, thus taking control.
				 
				The Great Kingdom decayed rapidly and Necro's Heart, yet controlled by the 
				Conjurer, became the center of his new Empire of Putrefaction. Soon after, 
				thousands of citizens arose as Necro's undead minions. The excelently trained, 
				battlehardened soldiers became easily distorted into his nefarious elite 
				personal army.
				 
				Ever since, the World's kingdoms and nations have been trying to hold the 
				Heart's Disease: Necro's unbeatable, conquering army. One small groups of 
				rebels from a different kingdom rose to the challenge and managed to stop the 
				Heart's advancement with unorthodox tactics. This gave the rest of the World a 
				chance to take a breath and assess the situation. After many years of fighting, 
				the biggest nations and kingdoms, races and factions, set their differences 
				aside and formed a Great Alliance to beat back the Heart's Disease.
				 
				Finally, with much effort and after many sacrifices, they managed to beat 
				Necro's army back to the Kingdom, now The Forsaken's Bastion. The Wizard 
				finds himself cornered and, much to his surprise, he's fightin war on two fronts 
				for Necro has unexplicably gained a will to fight and threatens his control over 
				the Heart and his entire army.
				 
				In this decisive battle, the Great Alliance puts everything and everyone on the 
				line to defeat the greatest enemy they have ever known. Their task is hard. 
				Lossing this bout means lossing their world to darkness...

				It's society is highly religious and conservative, defined by traditions and a 
				feudal system. There's a big difference between the common people and the 
				nobles, the ruled and the rulers. Members from one group can never change to 
				the other, “he who is born poor, dies poor”. This die-hard traditions have 
				remained intact for centuries, but the rise of new political powers and religious 
				entities shake the Kingdom's foundations as it fights for survival against new 
				forces, and of it's very existence against the changing tides of history. 

				The Regnum's rulers are ussually very proud of their power and social 
				standing. Religion is a very important matter for their society. They believe in 
				the existence of a God and a Goddess -Father and Mother. Both are opposites 
				that compliment each other: Fire and Water, Air and Earth, Sword and Shield, 
				Wrath and Forgiveness. This religion's organization is called the Church of the 
				Twin Suns; the bright Sun that comes at dawn and the Pale Sun that comes at 
				Dusk. The Father and the Mother, respectively.

				It's a belief that firmly establishes the concept of unity within a family and 
				thus, marriage is sacred; an unbreakable commitment. Adultery and Infidelity 
				is heavilly punished by law. But law tends to fall harder on the poor.

				Social hierarchy can be defined as a pyramid. The Head of State has total 
				control over the Regnum. Below him are the nobility, land-owners; wealthy 
				merchants and common citizens. The ruling head is both judge and jury and 
				has a personally appointed Royal Exsecutori.

				Seneca Castle is the Second Regnum's Capital city, older than the Kingdom 
				itself. It was destroyed at the end of a civil war -1100 years before the events 
				of FBF- after which the Second Regnum was born. A hundred years later, the 
				castle was rebuilt into the great citadel it is today. That event marks the year 
				zero in the Peninsula's timeline. Seneca Castle is admired by all for it's 
				historical and cultural meaning as well as for it's size and commercial 
				importance.

				A great empire now reduced to a small province in the northern mountains. 
				Only recently, it was a great Empire conquering the Second Regnum's lands 
				while fighting rebels inside it's borders. But the Forsaken became it's downfall.

				Distinctively opposite to the Second Regnum, the Imperium buids upon a series 
				of myths and teachings. There's a great Pantheon of Gods, with hundreds of 
				temples scattered through the Imperial lands. Despite the many different 
				beliefs, respect is king. Society looks down upon disrespectful priest and 
				believers.

				As free and democratic as the religion system is, the government is completely 
				tyranical and authoritarian. The Emperor holds all power over the law and the 
				land. Even so, he is close to common people as his agenda is heavilly invested 
				in public events. In the Imperium's religious beliefs the Emperor stands as a 
				prophet, a guardian.

				The Forsaken Kingdom, formerly the Kingdom d'Or, is the richest by far. Within

				the greatest castle ever built where upon sat the most vanidous of Kings, 
				Marco Mithas. A kingdom barely two-hundred years old, It reeks of death.
				
				A Wizard from the South tricked the King and took over his throne. Known as

				Kingdom.

				The Wizard succesfully waged war against it's unsuspecting neighbours at the

				Men fear what is new and unknown, that which is foreign to their own personal

				threatened and cornered by this things they fear, they treat them with disdain 
				and hostility.
				
				Men in the Peninsula fear the Bel'Trama for this reasons. A colossal mass of 
				Green-skinned men and manlike animals. Foreign and unknown, they are 
				different in every aspect to the common man. With the knowledge of their 
				existence came the realization that the World stretches far beyond their lands, 
				and their power over it may not be as great as they once thought.
				
				This outsiders known as the 'Outlanders' have set foot in the peninsula for the 
				first time, intervening in the war against the Forsaken. Although they should 
				be regarded as savior for pushing the Forsaken back, they are now feared even 
				more.

				A group of philosophers and scientist in the Imperium turned into enemies of 
				the state, turned into a group of ragtag rebels, turned into a new social and 
				political movement, turned into guardians of freedom and heroes of the 
				common men, turned into a new nation. A chain reaction that began with the 
				discovery of steam technology.
				
				The Imperium, at the time waging war against the Second Regnum, was unable 
				to quell the revolts organized by the Septem, a small insurgent group led by 
				seven intellectuals. In a matter of months, their small organization took towns 
				over from the Imperium and won the hearts of it's people. Eventually, the long 
				war against the Regnum and the sudden invasion from the East by the 
				Forsaken Army destroyed the Empire's forces. The rebellion recovered the 
				broken pieces to become the Respublica Nova Aurora, the Republic of the New 
				Dawn. And, although they did have to fight the Forsaken, the war ended 
				abruptly thanks to the surprising invasion launched by the 'Outlanders'.
				
				They've stayed away from the invasion against the Forsaken Bastion due to the 
				hostile relations with the Second Regnum and the weight of having to 
				reorganize their lands after the turmoil of the war against the Imperium. They 
				want to be ready for the upcoming wars against the Second Regnum and 
				possibly, the 'Outlanders'. They have an plan to free the world from corruption 
				and slavery, and they're are ready to give their lives for it.

			[tdalt]
				A cult of magic-wielders located in the 'Luna' island, south of the Peninsula, 
				territory of the Second Regnum. Only recently they made their existence public 
				by preaching the coming of The End and The Rebirth.
				
				They believe time is cyclical. The universe is created at the start of each cycle, 
				by an all-seeing Goddess ,who watches the world through the Moon -the Pale 
				Sun to the Church of the Twin Suns-, and ends with a cleansing of souls. At the 
				end of each cycle, the souls that remained pure return to the Goddess, as they 
				were once a part of her, while the rest are left to die as all existence returns to 
				zero. This cycle repeats itself indefinitely.
				
				A fatalistic belief that has found an enemy in the Church of the Twin Suns.
				
				Their leader and self-proclaimed messiah, (the POTM hero), claims she's been 
				sent by the Goddess to save as many as possible from the inevitable End, and 
				guide them back home; back to her womb. Her right hand, most faithful 
				servant and protector, (Cenarius) is a mute half-animal, three times as old as 
				the oldest man. He's a man more mysterious than the Cult itself.
				
				They have perceived a threat to their Goddess's plans in the Wizard and his 
				Forsaken, so the Order of the Moon has been rallied under the POTM's 
				command to fight side-by-side with the human armies.

			[tdalt]
				Before the construction of the Seneca Castle, of the wars for power and land, 
				of the coming of the first settlers, this was a virgin land. Untouched, unmarked 
				and unconquered. It was nature's paradise.
				
				The first settlers came down through the northern mountains, and in peace 
				they built their homes freely throughout the land. Years, decades passed as 
				they progressively expanded their domain and increased their numbers and, in 
				time, they had full control over the peninsula. This was the first kingdom, the 
				Seneca Region, ruled by Belliger Seneca and his family.
				
				About a hundred years before the creation of the Seneca Castle and the 
				Second Regnum, King Seneca Mare ventured with his fleet into the western 
				seas, looking to establish trade routes and new relations in undiscovered lands. 
				He never came back. It is said his fleet was destroyed and he and his crew 
				enslaved by Regira Sa'gara, the all-powerfull naga ruler of the western ocean. 
				The King left behind a dying wife and six male sons. The relations between the 
				heirs were very tense.
				
				The black sheep of the family was Seneca Primus, the eldest brother. Known 
				for his lust, greed and intricate plans. Loyal to himself. Seneca Secundus lived 
				overshadowed by his older brother. Since childhood he showed a great interest 
				in religion and became a well-read faithful man. His lifestyle gave little room to 
				concerns over land and money and this was a distressful matter for his father.
				
				The third and fourth sons were twins, Seneca Tertius and Quartus. They held 
				Seneca Primus as their role model until they discovered his treacherous nature. 
				A mix of their older brothers's traits, they had a strong sense of justice applied 
				to politics and the aristocratic life. Seneca Quartus had mixed feelings towards 
				religion and was an atheist in secret. The Fifth and Sixth sons, Seneca Quintus 
				and Sextus were by far the youngest, teenagers at the the time of the King's 
				dissappearance. As so, they were still seeking their place in the world. Both of 
				them were reckless and naive. 
				
				As the King had died, all the power was held by the Queen who fell ill with the 
				flu. Her sons took the hard decision of setting aside their differences and 
				formed a regent council of which only they were members. The Queen then 
				gave control of the Kigndom to this Council of Six.
				
				No more than a month later, the Queen died in her sleep and her offspring's 
				frail alliance was broken the day after. Chaos ensued aa brother fought brother 
				in the first of the Peninsula's great wars. The conflict ended with a siege that 
				completely destroyed the Seneca Castle and taook the life of the eldest of the 
				heirs, Seneca Primus, who had taken the structure by force. Afterwards, the 
				Seneca Region was broken into a smaller kingdom and four duchies. Seneca 
				Secundus, inherited the royal crown and his brothers took control of a different 
				duchy each.
				
				The Death of Seneca Primus, although tragic, brought peace to the land. He 
				had done much harm to the family, turning one against the other and playing 
				everyone for a fool, all in his search for power.

				When the Seneca Region was broken, the Council of Six was temporarily 
				summoned to choose and appoint the new King. Secundus was favored over 
				Quartus, as the latter stormed out of the meeting, forever to be his rival. The 
				Second Regnum began with the Second Son's rule, marked by his strong faith 
				and the rise of the church's power.
				
				With the following generations came peace and the reunification of the 
				kingdom. All of the peninsula lands were once again under the rule of one sole 
				king and the reconstruction of the Seneca Castle -ravaged by the heritage war 
				that split the royal family. Centuries later, the Kingdom would be divided yet 
				again when a rebellious general created the Imperium Borealis and later, a 
				nobleman called Marco Mithas would make a fast and vast fortune with which 
				to raise his own kingdom, the Kingdom d'Or  Known now as the Forsaken 
				Kingdom.

			[tdalt]
				In the year 555, General Patronus Aurel, rose up against the established rule 
				of the Second Regnum. A figure of rebellion and anti-establishment, he was 
				joined by other radical groups. The dissidents swiftly conquered most of the 
				northern provinces with minimun armed conflicts as the general's image was 
				more often than not, enough to rout the townsfolk in his favor. Yet, the dispute 
				was short-lived.
				
				The King and the General arranged for a private meeting that lasted several 
				hours. A peace had been arranged where the general's rebellious campaign of 
				warmongering and conquest had to end in exchange of all the conquered lands. 
				Rumor has it that the General received a hefty sum of money during the 
				encounter. The King's treaty also established that the General's future castle 
				was not to be bigger or larger in any extent and meaning to that of his 
				kingdom. 
				
				The General held all of the power as he was loved by his people and was 
				considered a hero for decades and centuries even after his death. Patronus 
				Aurel had no appointed heir and the three richest families of the region became 
				bitter rivals in the struggle for power. The three families engaged in a silent 
				conflict where hired killers, spies and thieves filled their pockets with gold and 
				jewels. In the end two of the families gave up on their claims to the throne 
				and, since then, the victorious family ruled unquestionably until the very end.

				The political scene in the Imperium is considerably different and so is it's 
				religion. They believe in the existence of many gods. Each represents an 
				element of nature: The sun, the earth, air, water, fire, lightning & thunder (said 
				to be twin brothers), and so on. Each of the Gods are made known to the 
				people by several myths and stories. Different temples can be found all 
				throughout the Northern lands. Different Gods have different teachings and 
				traditions but the diferent cults treat each other with utmost respect. Life for 
				the common man tended to be more peaceful and less occupied in political 
				affairs than in the Second Regnum. 
				
				About ten to twenty years ago, the Secundian King declared war on the 
				Imperium claiming a right to it's territories, and just like that, began the 
				longest and most gruesome war that concludes with the Fall of the Forsaken 
				Bastion. The Secundian King fell ill and died not long after the start of the war 
				and since the Queen was unskilled in the art of warfare, her kingdom soon fell 
				under the raw power of the Imperial Army. Yet, at the same time a small group 
				off in the western territories of the Empire made a giant breakthrough with the 
				creation of a fully functional steamboat. This technology was used by a group 
				of dissident that managed to oppose the Empire's vast army.
				
				The Rebellion slowly pushed the Empire's forces back while at the same time, 
				the Queen was forced out of Seneca Castle and into the southern provinces. 
				Such continuous state of war drove the Empire to ruin and soon, the Regnum 
				pushed them back. It was then that the Forsaken surprised all with a vast army 
				of undead and put the final nail on the Imperium's coffin. 
				
				The Emperor was executed and the Imperium Borealis was turned into a 
				vassal state by the rebels. Fully organized they called their land and 
				government the Nova Republic; the Dawning Republic.

				In most of the Imperium, religion was a great part of every peasant's life but 
				this was not the case in the westernmost towns. Many began looking for 
				answers on the different sciences and through years of independent research 
				and experimentation a group of engineers found a way to use the power of 
				water and steam for the operation of mechanical contraptions.
				
				The revolution turned from scientific to political when seven intellectuals saw 
				the rise of this new tech as the signs of change. The technology had been 
				created by people in the farthest corners of the Imperium. It became easily 
				accessible to all and potentially powerful. This meant that simple untrained 
				peasants with access to it would be able to fight against the spears and swords 
				of the Imperial Army and the Second Regnum, even if outnumbered.
				
				They called themelves Septem and thought it was time for the people to rule 
				over themselves. All those tired of the Emperors' tyranical regime joined the 
				ranks of the 'Steam Hunters', the armed group ruled by the Septem.
				
				The first weeks of the armed rebellion were peaceful. The neighbouring towns 
				either surrendered or voluntarily joined them because of their technological 
				prowess or their revolutinizing ideals. The Imperial Army underestimated the 
				new rising powers and only sent a middle sized battallion to face them. 
				Needless to say, the first battle was a sound victory for the inexperienced 
				Hunters.
				
				The war turned out to be not as easy as the Septem had thought. The Empire 
				had many more soldiers in reserve and the central cities and towns did not 
				cede their control to the rebels so easilly. The Imperium Borealis was finally 
				taken down as the war on three fronts was too much for it's army and it's 
				economy.
				
				Feelings of peace and joy rose in the hearts of the rebels but not for long. The 
				Imperium's retreat came at the cost of the Forsaken's advance. The rebels now 
				had to defend the lands they just conquered. The Ultimate test, their 
				technology was to face the most powerful Black Magic.
				
				With the help of the 'Outlanders', the Forsaken were driven back and a new 
				government was settled. From the ashes of tirany and the rubble of war, the 
				Nova Republic was built. Housing their capital in the city where it all began, 
				the Septem formed a parliament. Each of them became a minister and, 
				toghether, they rule the Republic. The power falls on the people and their task 
				is to enforce it.
				
				New laws were passed, ones that would assure the peasant's rights and the 
				nation's integrity. The various religions were left untouched as the intellectuals 
				believed in the freedom of thought as Freedom was their motto and what they 
				stood for. But their goals go far from freeing a few men on the north, far from 
				control over a portion of land. Their goals are to bring down tiranny, to prove 
				that there is no divine right to rule over someone else, to show people what 
				true freedom is; To bring a new Dawn.

				What was Seneca Quintus's Duchy was eventually absorbed by the Second 
				Regnum and turned into one of its provinces. Around the year 800 ASC (After 
				Seneca Castle) a young and ambicious nobleman was tasked with ruling the 
				province, his name was Marco Mithas. During his rule, a seemingly infinite 
				amount of resources was uncovered in his land. Cunning Crassio decided to 
				hide this knowledge from the King and all that were loyal to him by any means 
				necessary. The King found out only too late. Marco Mithas crowned himself 
				King Crassio of Regnum Marco and severed all connections to the Second 
				Regnum.
				
				As his first royal comand, he ordered the creation of a small army of elite 
				soldiers, the Knights d'Or; loyal to the end. The Secundian King wanted the 
				lands that were his by right and, of course, the vast resources it held. But his 
				army, although three times superior in number was obliterated and humilliated 
				by the Chevaliers. The Second Regnum was forced to recognize the new King. 
				 
				King Crassio eventually acquired all he ever wanted, but as time past him by 
				he lost his youth and beauty. Desperate, he fell right into a travelling wizard's 
				scheme; his name unkown, people reffered to him as 'Cáligo'. 'Cáligo' became 
				close to the King until he cast a spell that doubled as a curse. The spell made 
				Crassio recover his youth, but his next male son would become an Eater of 
				Souls and the first he would claim would be the King's. The Wizard's plan 
				succeeded, but that was only the first phase.
				
				The Prince's body was just a new vessel to replace the wizard's; old and frail. 
				Young, strong and with the power of all the enslaved souls, 'Cáligo' could 
				become the greatest dark mage.
				
				Unfortunately for him, his plan failed. He did not know about the Prince's Inner 
				Strenght, his essence, pure like a god; waiting silently for the right time to 
				emerge and clash with the Wizard's blight. A battle takes place in a 
				dimmension unperceivable by the human eye.
				
				The encounter is too great and the Prince's body implodes, leaving only Marco 
				Vas's Golden Heart, the last remaining piece of the prince's body wherein 
				resides his soul, his pure essence engulfed by all the souls absorbed, now 
				under the Wizards' control. Still, one free soul fights the wizard besides that of 
				the Prince: Marco Mithas's, selflessly battling for his son's freedom.  
				The Wizard still had control over Black Magic and so, he made his foe suffer by 
				cursing his kingdom with undeath. Proving he's still in control, he raised an 
				army off the dead and used it to conquer the Peninsula.
				
				While the Imperium Borealis had pushed back the Secundian Army over and 
				over again with impressive might and strength, it quickly fell to the Noir 
				Knights, formerly Marco Mithas's elite army. The Chevaliers advanced 
				relentlessly, taking and destroying all in it's way, but the rising rebellious group 
				to the west that had fought off the Empire's army proved to be a challenge to 
				the Wizard's. And just as the Forsaken had spread towards the west and the 
				south, the 'Outlanders' invaded from the North, across the sea.
				
				The Invasion marked a new turnabout in the war. The 'Outlanders'' raw 
				strength and great numbers broke the Forsaken army's might. The Chevaliers 
				fell back to face this new enemy granting a moment of peace to the rising 
				Republic and the Second Regnum. In just a few months, the Forsaken army 
				was broken, and the Forsaken Bastion all that remained. 
				
				Now, the tired champions of the Second Regnum, the eager 'Outlanders' and a 
				mysterious new cult stand at the Bastion's Gates. The ultimate battle will 
				begin. The Heart's control is at stake, but if it manages to fend off the attack it 
				may just be enough to conquer the Peninsula once and for all.
