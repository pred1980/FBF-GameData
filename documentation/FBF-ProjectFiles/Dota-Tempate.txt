	"[I]I have seen it in the mud covered face of the southern men; I have seen it in the warmongering north, and even in the god's forgotten, dead plagued army. Change...[/I]"
	~~Brother Baritos, Philosopher and Priest of the 'Twin Suns Church'

	For almost twenty years, war has plagued the Seneca Region: a peninsula divided by several nations and cultures essentially different one from the other. The original conflict between two major kingdoms triggered several major events as new religious and political groups rose to power. New technologies led to new philosophies and new ways of life, new ways to experience the world and new ways to rule society. The Seneca Region is in a state of change.

	Amidst the chaos of change and the evolving societies, an old demon returned to the land. A Wizard, the last member of a forgotten cult long thought to been vanquished, executed a master plan to raise an undead army and enforce his twisted, necromantic black magic upon the world. He calls himself Cáligo and his kin, The Forsaken.

	Cáligo entered the court of King Marco Mithas, a man whose greed was as big as his vast wealth. The naive King was easily tricked by the Wizard who cast a curse on him and his new born son, Marco Vas. Cáligo raised the Prince into his puppet, thus ruling the Kindom from the shadows. To channel the energies that would raise the undead, it was necessary to have a healthy body. Cáligo would transfer his soul from his frail carcass to Vas's younger form. But Vas proved to be a fighter on the inside. The invisible struggle that took place between them caused the Prince's body to implode, leaving in place his beating heart covered by the Wizard's magic.

	Despite the outcome, the Heart raised an army of undead and executed it's campaign of terror over the exhausted people of the Seneca Region that had been fighting each other for years. The Prince's resistance was a major setback in Cáligo's plans, but what ultimately caused his defeat was 'change'. During the time he was executing his plan, the ways to wage war changed radically in the Region, new weapons that could make a simple peasant beat an expert swordman were readily available and, in the end, the Forsaken were pushed back.

	Now, the Heart awaits deep within it's Bastion and the tired champions of the endless wars stand at the gates, ready to vanquish The Forsaken once and for all. Undoubtedly, this battle is the last as both the Forsaken and the Alliance of Nations put every man on the line. The winner takes all.

	[SIZE="3"][COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]Gameplay and Mechanics[/COLOR][/SIZE]

	Forsaken Bastion's Fall is a multiplayer map that pits two sides, of up to 6 players each, one against the other. One of the teams, The Forsaken, has to defend the fortress from the Alliance team that's trying to reach the end and destroy the source of magic that keeps the defenders alive.

	The players start in the Tower Defense stage, where The Forsaken team has to strategically place a series of diferent towers to stop the Alliance and it's waves of minions from reaching the entrance. The total number of waves is limited to 20 so the Alliance players need to end this stage as quickly as possible.

	When the Alliance reaches the Bastion's Gates, the AoS stage begins. Here is when the Forsaken players take control of their chosen heroes. Alonside minions of their own and NPC Forsaken Bosses, they will have to defend the corridors of the stronghold from the Alliance's efforts to reach the end. The Alliance wins if they do so within the 20 minion waves, and the Forsaken win if they succesfully defeat all waves before their enemies complete their goal. 

	[SIZE="3"][COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]Tower Defense[/COLOR][/SIZE]

	The tower defense is the first part of every wave and is solely played by the Undead. The Infidel can not interfere with the actions of the Undead players in that area. The defense strength is designed, and their HP and numbers are adjusted so that this number is achieved no matter how many Undead players there are in the game.

	The towers are pretty standard towers you will see in most TDs, mostly meant for dealing damage, and only a handful have special abilities and effects.

	The towers are paid in wood, which is given to the players at the end of every round and can not be obtained in another way. 

	[SIZE="3"][COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]Hero Battle[/COLOR][/SIZE]

	Once the Alliance players reach the entrance of the fortress, the second stage begins. The Forsaken players now control their own heroes and all playable character statistics are rebalanced to fit the stage. The Alliance players will have a tougher time dealing with their enemies, as they not only face player heroes but, also, the Forsaken minion waves and a set number of bosses. Even more, the wave count keeps getting lower and if it reaches 0, the Alliance will lose.

	Things don't get easier for the defending players as they lose the protection of the towers and run the risk of being vulnerable to their enemy's attacks.

		It was thus written in old legends that on the clearest of nights, when the winds of the Peninsula were calm and peaceful, and the traveling merchants felt safe and secure, little would they suspect that they were being watched by an uncanny rider called Mundzuk and Octar, his ride, whose might and savageness were matched only by Mundzuk's battle proficiency. Rushing from the shadows with speed like a midnight blast, the victims of this duo never had a chance to retaliate before they were slain mercilessly. As if on the wings of the wind, the mysterious figures, having gathered up their trophies of the hunt, would vanish without a trace. The Behemoth's reign of terror lasted for many years until the day the hands of death claimed their life.

		Centuries later, the Wizard, by the machinations of fate, discovered a nameless tomb containing the remains of the legendary rider, who had always been thought of as a myth. The Wizard offered them a second chance in life in exchange for their unquestionable loyalty. The fearsome Behemoth has returned, serving in the frontline of the Forsaken army and crushing all who dare oppose his new master's will.

			Warriors often laugh at arachnophobia.

			They always think spiders are nothing comparing to the beasts they fight daily.

			But little they know of the Spiders underground.

			Legs as tall as a door and fangs open as wide as a man's head,

			The Widow crawls from beneath the earth to haunt on her victims.

			Caught up. Webbed. Swarmed. Incapacitated. Consumed.

			The Nerubian Widow finishes her meal quickly and spits out pieces of armor.

			She then proceeds to the next prey.

			[I]"When hell freezes over, the cold shall traverse the Peninsula."[/I] – Akull, the Cold Jester. 

			 A tale that sent chills down one’s spine told of a frosty jester who was cold and ever-bitter. Fed up with being given the cold shoulder all the time by this unfunny buffoon, his Lord used the harsh harvest of one winter as an excuse to kill off the jester in cold blood, proclaiming his death as a sacrifice to the Winter God. The jester's heart was the only thing left, frozen and buried in the snow.

			Many years later, when the Lord was taking a stroll in his winter garden, as the cool breezes brushed past him, a freezing mist that materialized into a monstrous being exuding a bone-chilling aura appeared in front of him. “Ice to meet you, m'lord” were the last words the Lord heard before he was frozen solid and shattered. It is said that the former jester has returned, now known only as the Ice Avatar, and he has brought the icy apocalypse to this world.

			Renowned for his unmatched valor and prowess, Edmund Shieldbearer --brother to Edgar Shieldbearer, a Paladin of the Twin Suns Church--, was a general of the Regnum respected by his allies and feared by his enemies. During the war against the Empire, he regrettably fell in battle at the tip of a dozen spears. The proper ceremonies were made, but soon after, the body disappeared.

			The cruel strings of fate designated that his body become the ingredient for the Wizard’s daring experiment to create an undead abomination. Unholy magic from ancient eldritch grimoire ended up creating a frightening monstrosity. This being no longer feels fear, remorse or self-preservation. Charging into the battlefield with zero hesitation and maximum ferocity, 'the Ghoul' claws its way through the corpses of its former brethren in a never-ending fervor, as they stand frozen in awe, witnesses to the cruel fate of their hero, and ideal role model.

			Legend has it that many years ago there lived a beautiful woman who was loved and cherished by all, called Lady Venefica. As time went by, she grew old and lost her appeal. Turning to witchcraft as her last resort, the woman followed an ancient ritual of sacrificing children and absorbing their essence to restore her youth. Her actions were noticed by the holy men and she was hanged afterwards. Suffering for days as the stolen life force slowly slipped away, until one day she finally died.

			A few years later, the holy men who had hanged the woman before were met on the road with mysterious sounds that began to emanate from all around them. Desperately casting all their holy spells and magic to no avail, they ran in terror as fear invaded their mighty hearts. The wailing and weeping, like a child's cry, split the silence of the night unyielding. What ensued next was a symphony of screams and blood, concluding with a sonata of eerie silence.

			Beware, for you may be the next…

			The Knights d’Or was an army of elite knights handpicked by King Mithas himself. Under the leadership of, Great Knight Dorian a battle-hardened general, the army was able to hold its ground against overwhelming odds on numerous occasions. However, even the mightiest will eventually fall.

			A loyal and close subject to the King, he was a liability to the Wizard who personally slain the trusting soldier while disguised as his liege. In a twist of irony, Dorian became a horrifying being known only as the Death Marcher. Now he stands tall and relentless as an impenetrable wall that protects the Forsaken Bastion. The combination of deadly magic and inhuman strength in the hand of such a merciless being demoralize all who witness its presence.

			The Magi’s Guild, an advanced school of magic ruled by the Philosopher's Council, had once been the utopia of all magicians in the land. They were the first to witness the blighted Forsaken Army as they were the deadly enemies of the Wizard, who had lost his brethren at the hands of this magic wielders. All slain in the onslaught.

			Now the guild has become the domain of the Skeleton Mage, The Archmage and leader of the former council, punished to eternal undeath and servitude by the Wizard. Employing empowered necromantic magic sliding towards decay and soul manipulation, this shamble of bones seeks pleasure in cursing enemies with horrendous plagues, watching them die in agony and absorb their souls to grow stronger. Only eternal damnation awaits those who encounter this creature.

			Necromancers. Masters of the dark arts of death. Renowned for their ability to summon undead forces from the corpses of slain enemies and turn even their former comrades into mindless, brutal skeletons. They are an indispensable portion of the Wizard’s army. One among them, however, wishes beyond being a mere death caller.

			Kakos Tabularius researched forbidden tomes and descended further into the dark art, obtaining powers that far exceed a normal necromancer’s capability. Careless, he went a step too far and experimented secret necromastery arts on his own body, turning himself into an undead being. The unexpected result did not disappoint him in the slightest, for he had finally made a breakthrough by being the only to actually tread the border of life and death. This nameless magician, now known among his enemies as the Master Necromancer, walks into battle alone and comes out escorted by loyal minions that trample the lifeless bodies of his foes.

			Reports from a remote region of the Peninsula detailed how a small village was wiped out virtually overnight and the bodies of the villagers were all murdered in a horrendous, brutal manner. The Wizard, who was situated nearby, did not miss out the occasion to investigate this mystery. Arriving at the scene, his men were ambushed by oversized, vicious beetles. However, the attack proved to be fruitless as the Wizard effortlessly repelled the creatures and pushed them back to their hive: a tremendous ancient temple.

			The subsequent excavation resulted in the unearthing of the skeleton of a giant, monstrous beetle. Figuring an apparent link between this skeleton and the earlier attacks, the Wizard decided on a whim to resurrect this enigmatic being, injecting an unwavering loyalty to it in the process. This 'Lord of the Crypt', called so by his new master is considered an exceptionally filthy and despicable being even among the undead masses as it possesses horrifying abilities, including ambushing the enemies from below, injecting his spawn to them and watching with pleasure as his young bursts forth from the corpse of the victim.

			Ancient tomes speak of a malicious necromantic ritual involving sewing the corpses of different beings together and attaching them to a single frame to create a grotesque being. The Wizard did not miss out the opportunity to experiment this ritual first hand and aptly named the resulting creature an 'Abomination'. Needless to say, he went far beyond creating one simple 'Abomination' and developed a machine run with steam technology to mass produce the tortured freaks.

			One of this 'Abominations' is called Blight Cleaver. Hidden beneath his monstrous and brutish exterior is a cunning intelligence that allows this creature to plan tactics and stratagems, that exceed those of the common brutes that define his brethren; often reduced to running and smashing all that moves and can scream. Blight Cleaver roams the battlefield, a blob of meat planning the best way to snack upon his preys and push the battle line, as the unspeakable horror ensues in deadly silence.

			Cleave:
			The Abomination's brutal strikes hit several units at once, a bonus percentage of the damage. There's a small chance to stun or knockback weaker units.

			Plague Cloud:
			Each unit that comes in range of Blight Cleaver has a chance to get infected with the plague, taking damage over time. Each infected unit also has a low chance to infect others. The plague disappears after a few seconds if the unit is not reinfected.

			[IMG]http://media.moddb.com/images/articles/1/143/142841/auto/snack.jpg[/IMG]
			Snack:
			Blight Cleaver joyfully feasts on an enemy hero, damaging him and healing himself for an equal amount. The enemy cannot move while being eaten. If the victim dies in the process, Blight Cleaver will permanently gain 3 points in Strength.

		[TABLE="Heroes"][CENTER][SIZE="3"][COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]Story[/COLOR][/SIZE]

			Many centuries ago, there existed a great mage with an unquenchable thirst for exploring the secret arts. This caused him to venture into forbidden territories and be branded a menace by the Twin Suns Church and the Magi's Guild alike; institutions that often find themselves one against the other. Finding himself cornered in the Tomb he made his hideout, the mage cast a desperate spell that turned his body into a sphere of pure mana quickly dissipating into thin air. An abandoned obsidian construct nearby, retaining traces of necromantic magic of its initial creation, absorbed the mage’s essence over the years and finally reconstituted his consciousness within its structure.

			This nature-defying creature now serves the Forsaken as the official torturer and executor of the Wizard's enemies, acomplice of the creation of many of the creatures under the Great Conjurer's command. The Destroyer serves under the promise of a new body. Psionic annihilation is the only thing that awaits those who cross his path.

			Before the coming of the Wizard, King Mithas had Tristan Langue d'Argent, his right hand, his chancellor, his advisor. This man had the unique ability to make the best our of any situation, specially when it came at the cost of others. His many tasks ranged from attending to important diplomatic meetings in the name of his liege, to making sure the people always owed the crown tax money and payed the debts in full amount. Interest rates included.

			The Wizard soon took his place at the King's side with his silver tongue. But the Chancellor could see he and the Conjurer had much in common. This meant it was obvious to Tristan his new rival was lying and acting his way through a plot. At just the right moment he approched the outsider and offered him a devil's deal: he would betray his King in exchange of power and a high position under the Wizard's new rule, whom didn't consider him an equal as much as a useful pet. The deal came through, but at the cost of his sanity and image. He follows his new master with blind faith, too crazed to see the consequences of his actions.

			Among the numerous mercenary clans scattering around the Peninsula, there is a unique nameless guild operated by a single assassin, who is also the one to take care of contracted jobs. This female archer is tricky, treacherous and possesses an unrivaled marksmanship, befitting her title of the Dark Ranger. The origin of the Dark Ranger is shrouded in mystery. Some say she descended from a secret tribe of female warriors to the North that worships the gods of war, while others claim she is an assassin raised from birth and her arrows had never missed ever since she knew how to use a bow.

			Enemies of the Dark Ranger often find themselves being chased by a ghostly archer and incapacitated by spectral arrows that pierce their soul. Even if the Ranger is missing from sight, her arrow is as deadly as ever and the victims only hear of the whizzing sound before their lives are forfeited. Fighting among the undead masses for sole monetary purposes, her bow is ready to bring the holy warriors to their knees.
