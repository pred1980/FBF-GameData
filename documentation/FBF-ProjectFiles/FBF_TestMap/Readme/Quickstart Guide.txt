This guide assumes that you only want to use the default AI for your units.
It guides you through implementing the most basic parts of the system and
configuration along with running AI for units.

1) Implement the required libraries. This can be done by the following:
    i) Going to each url listed in the system and copying the code from the
        required library. This ensures that the libraries are up-to-date.
    ii) Copying the triggers in the folder  "Required Libraries" into your map.
    (GetClosestWidget, NewTable, RegisterPlayerUnitEvent,
    and TimerUtils)
2) Copy the triggers called HeroAI, HeroAIItem, and HeroAILearnset into your map.
3) HeroAILearnset Configuration:
    Go to the HeroAILearnset trigger
    Configure the globals, MAX_SKILL_LVL, MULTIPLE_SKILLS_PER_LVL, and
    MAX_SKILL_PER_LVL.

    If you have morphing heroes, make sure HAVE_MORPH_HEROES is set to true
    and follow the specified syntax for configuring them near the bottom of
    SetupLearnset.
    If you don't have morphing heroes, set HAVE_MORPH_HEROES to false and
    remove any morphing configuration in "SetupLearnset."

    Now, follow the syntax specified in the function "SetupLearnset" to add skills for all heroes in your map at the level they should learn it.
4) Inside HeroAIItem, go to "private function SetupItems takes nothing returns nothing"
    Register all items the AI can buy by following the syntax specified.
    It is also advised to register any non-power up item the hero can pick up so that it can refund it properly.
5) Inside HeroAIItem, go to "private function SetupDefaultItemBuild takes nothing returns nothing"
    Follow the syntax specified to create a default item build that all
    AI heroes will have.
6) Configure the constants in HeroAIItem.
7) In HeroAI, configure the function IsSafeUnit so that your AI heroes will
    have a spot to run to. Basically, it should check if the unit can provide
    some kind of healing
8) To actually run the AI for a unit, you need to call the function RunHeroAI,
    which takes a unit parameter.
    It's advised to call the function when the hero is picked.

    The RunAIForAllHeroes trigger shows how to run the AI for all hero units on the map

Optional add-ons:
It's relatively easy to add in any of the optional libraries because their triggers only need to be copied over into your map and you can easily configure the globals.
