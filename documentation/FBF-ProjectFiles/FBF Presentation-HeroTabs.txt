												The Tau, a bull-like race of Bel'Trama tribals, have been subject to slavery for as long as their ancestors lived. They have a long lifespan, incredibly strong bodies, and a very submissive and peaceful nature. These traits make them the perfect and most valued slaves. Baccar was a vassal of the Ajdar tribe. While the Bel'Trama believe in many gods, Baccar pledged his faith to only one: Shams, the omnipotent Sun-God. For insulting the Ajdari and their beliefs, he's gotten the worst treatment a slave can receive.

												Every so often, Baccar received the visit of Shams' Messenger who eased his pain and spoke to him about his god's teachings, how all the Tau seek freedom deep within their hearts, and how they would acquire it in due time. Baccar became anxious but patiently awaited through the years. The dreams came more often until one night the Messenger simply said “Freedom is paid with Patience. Justice is paid with Blood. The Sun's light is paid with Repentance. The Tau have paid.”  The next morning, Baccar's slave group was woken earlier for the weekly “head-count”. The slaves' work was judged by the Tamers. Those that didn't pass were beheaded, and their bodies saved for the dinner's soup. The first slave judged didn't pass and the moment his severed head hit the ground, the Tau were free.

												With a roar that made the ground tremble, Baccar broke his chains. Fists so closed in anger his claws pierced his hands, he began tearing through the Ajdari tamers. Skulls were crushed, jaws were broken, and the green-skinned beasts were torn in half as if they were made of bread. The incesant roaring clouded the screams and pleas for help. The other slaves watched in awe. At the master tent, Baccar's owner was kneeling, frozen, whispering meaningless apologies as the Tau slave raised his fists high and swinged downwards, breaking his foe's neck, thrusting the head into the body below the shoulder line. In the aftermath, Baccar felt both released and ashamed, unsure of himself and his actions.

												For the Tau, he became the prophet that guides them to freedom, the true Tau Nabi. Baccar also became the Tau'ren, Chieftain of the Tribe and organized them as an army that grew larger in number as more of their kin were fred. Yet, along the way, he became the enemy of the Bel'Trama tribes and in order to escape and divide them the Tau have set sail southward. South towards the Peninsula. Right into a war that was not their own.

												Just like one lion rules a pack, one tribe rules the Bel'Trama, one clan rules a tribe, and one man rules a clan. Sahkra, the Oathbreaker rules the Ajdar Tribe and the Bel'Trama through sheer strenght and a cunning mind. Even if old he is unmatched, and to keep his reputation and seat of power he provokes even his closest friends into a deathmatch that, by tradition, one's rejection means one's loss of honor, and dignity. Even if everyone knows Sahkra's forbidden spells and traps are always the cause of his rivals' deaths, they dare not decline the match. The Ajdar Chieftain made it his hobby and enjoys every bit of these duels, particularly the crowd's reaction to his grand finale: slowly plucking his thumbs into his foe's eyes until his long nails pierce the skull.

												Upon learning of the rising of the Tau slaves and the story of their great prophet, Sahkra gathered his clan and marched west towards the slave mines to meet the rebels. Too unprepared and relaxed at the sight of an easy battle, the Ajdari army was caught offguard midway through. On a foggy night, the Tau greeted them with bloddied clubs and sharp horns. The mist covered their entrance and the massacre began. Before the Ajdar could organize themselves and before Sahkra got out of his tent, the field was painted with green blood and the gutted bodies of half his army. The rest threw their weapons at the order of a young Tau who revealed himself as Tau Nabi Baccar. He spoke to a grudgeful Sahkra about his encounter with his god, Shams, and his plan to free the Tau. He finished by saying “Shams wants you alive. I want you to row.” 

												The dishonored green-skins rowed the Tau's stolen boats southwards into the Peninsula. For the first time, Sahkra's men are losing hope in him. They begin to see him as a frail old Ajdar whose time has ran out. A feeling worsened by the unending battles they have found in the new land and their new foe, the Forsaken. But Sahkra feels this enemy is his chance to get his men back and to prove the falsehood of the Tau Nabi.

												Almost by rule, the Bel'trama know the Ajdar as the most savage and selfish brutes but Hakim, a green-skinned eventhough a hermit, is an exception. He lives within the tribe's lands but distanced from it's towns, avoiding most social contact. He prefers the purity of the wilderness and a life cultivating his spirit over warmongering. When he comes accross a caravan he begs for a bowl of food instead of stealing and killing. When he spends long periods of time in the wilds he feeds off what nature gives him or not at all. But even if he seems defenseless, raiders and robbers fear him for his ability to “summon the Thunders”.

												On a muddy trail, below a full moon night, a party of hooded riders blocked Hakim's path; surrounding him but at a reasonable distance. Even if they wanted to attack, the wolves they rode wouldn't obey out of respect to The Wise as if he was their pack's alpha male. One rider dismounted and threw his weapons to the side of the muddy road. With just a nod he signalled the others to rush back to their camp. Unhooded he was when he spoke to Hakim. The Wise had never seen his friend so troubled, afraid of his failures and of the death that creeped behind him; it was the only thing he spoke of. This Ajdari always came to Hakim for advice in times of trouble and even so he was rude, The Wise always complied kindly. Even if usually they went separate ways after their secret meetings, this time the Farseer decided to join his party. He too could feel the death that haunted him.

												He journeyed with the Ajdari. He hadn't done so in decades, and the stench of blood brought back memories and the spirits of those that fell at his hands. Yet, just like the wolves, they respected Hakim. They showed him a glimpse of his future: a land unknown, a sea of blood, a castle of rusty gates and old stones, death, and rebirth.
