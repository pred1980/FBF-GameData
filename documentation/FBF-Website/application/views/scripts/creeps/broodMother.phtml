		erubians are among the races that have populated the Peninsula since time immemorial. Feral, instinctive and immensely powerful, Nerubians prefer to weave giant webs deep in underground caves to serve as each individual’s own kingdom rather than forming communities. Whoever treads upon the woven strings will be hunted down and consumed, be it a fellow Nerubian or not. A nameless Nerubian, while carrying out the traditional murder of trespassers, unknowingly killed a demonic warlock and unleashed a curse upon herself. From that point onwards, her mind became consumed with madness and her body periodically laid eggs that, instead of spawning normal offspring as they were supposed to, create monstrous spiderlings that hungered for flesh and aggressively hunted down any living things in the vicinity. Many years later, the fateful day came when a small Forsaken squad was killed by the spiderlings. The news reached the Wizard and he did not miss the opportunity to harness this twisted perversion of nature to bolster the might of the Forsaken forces.

		The cursed Nerubian, now bore the name Brood Mother given by the Wizard, ultimately became another accessory in the Wizard’s unholy quest.
		This horrific arachnid and her offspring now stands between the holy warriors and the Heart. If the Nerubian Widow could not teach the fools arachnophobia, the Brood Mother will.
